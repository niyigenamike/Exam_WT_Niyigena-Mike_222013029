The Photographer Remote Work Collaboration platform is designed to facilitate seamless interaction and project management between photographers and administrators. This web-based application supports two types of user accounts: photographers and admins. Photographers can upload their work, share project updates, and participate in group chats, while admins manage users, oversee projects, and monitor system activities. The application ensures efficient collaboration through features such as project tracking, task assignment, and real-time communication.
