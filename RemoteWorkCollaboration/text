okay chat this is the table then create it's crud as we used to do it before and then the new thing in when creating for for image textField allow user to select multiple images a(which are not more than 10) and then after that after selecting you will do two things first display them below the textField (use css to make them small)and then then the second thing is add them(there names) in single array called selectedImages and then add them in the database column(sharedImage) as a string which are separated with(,) and then in tablular view what we are going to do is tat in action display a button called (view shared image) that when user clicks it show model that display all images okay chat and remember we are adding all images in uploads/ okay chat so chat do that for me and an other thing you need to knwo is column userId in the databse willl be a session[id]
